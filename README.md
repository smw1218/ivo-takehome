# Contract Renderer

This was generated using cursor and then edited for correctness.

Things I would do givne more time:

    * Custom CSS: the document would be better served by a small subset of consistent styles; it was faster to pull in tailwind though
    * Split the ContractNodeRenerer to not have any inline JSX components
    * Figure out a specification for clause numbering and follow that; I'm not sure how/if this generalizes across documents. I took a guess
